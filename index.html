                              <p>MAY 6, 2017: Ah, the 'ol sophmore slump. The expectation of recreating the charms of the debut but not duplicating it, or scaring people away with too much experimentation. Fortunately, we just saw it as a chance to do more of more. And sometimes more means less (being a band with 'minimalist' tendencies.) Basically: sharper, more tightly edited, and with a more serious studio approach. Captured in one room with little separation, yet completed 740 miles apart: 'Sinking' is where raw spontanaeity meets modern techniques.</p>

                      <p>Otherwise, we're approaching our 2nd year of being a band that live several states apart. Shows and practices happen infrequently, and I find myself saying no to invitations a lot. Sorry folks, those are just the realities. However, we are very excited to be a part of the ATI benefit shows happening at Bottom Lounge, while acknowledging the sorry political state that made it possible. It's important to come together and remind each other that people CAN be good, and we're probably witnessing the pathetic final pouts of a dying worldview. But before busting out the schadenfreude popcorn, we must recognize the vulnerable ends of society being effected in the present: people are dying because of all this. TL/DR: let's raise 5 figures for some good organizations, and do it while playing with bands we listened to as teenagers. Which is completely weird! (and all the more reason to embrace it.) -BP</p>
